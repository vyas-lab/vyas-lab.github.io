Dr. Shruti Vyas is an interdisciplinary researcher whose work brings together chemical engineering, computer vision, and artificial intelligence to address challenges in sustainability, energy, and industrial diagnostics. She earned her Ph.D. in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from the National University of Singapore and her B.Tech. from IIT (BHU) Varanasi, and also spent three years in industry as a process design engineer before moving into academic research.

Her postdoctoral work at the University of Central Florida focused on representation learning and visual understanding using deep learning, laying the foundation for her current research. At UCF, she leads a group developing intelligent, data-driven methods for applications such as molecular property prediction, photovoltaic defect detection and recycling, geolocalization, and industrial hazard identification.

Guided by the vision of bringing the benefits of AI into experimental science, Dr. Vyas aims to accelerate discovery and create innovative solutions with meaningful real-world impact.
