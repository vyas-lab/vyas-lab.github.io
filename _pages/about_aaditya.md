Aaditya is a PhD student at UCF working at the intersection of computer vision, multimodal AI, and robotics. His research focuses on developing robust and interpretable models for real-world applications, spanning areas such as foundation models, zero/few-shot learning, multimodal inference, and generative modeling.

Before joining UCF, Aaditya gained industry experience at Bosch, Siemens Energy, and the startup AlphaBake, where he worked on applied machine learning and intelligent system design. These experiences shaped his ability to bridge theoretical advances with practical engineering solutions.

Aaditya has also developed a range of impactful projectsâ€”from ViTLoc, a transformer-based localization system, to GEAR, an ensemble model for GAN detection, and gesture-controlled robotic platforms. His work reflects a strong blend of innovation, technical rigor, and applicability.
