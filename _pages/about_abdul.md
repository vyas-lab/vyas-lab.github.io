Abdul is a PhD student at UCF whose research focuses on adapting advanced deep learning models to address complex computer vision challenges in industrial and engineering domains. Working in collaboration with Siemens Energy, he has contributed to improving operational systems by tailoring general-purpose models for domain-specific tasks. His approach also involves designing strategies to maximize the utility of training data to improve model performance.
Before beginning his doctoral studies, he built a versatile career with experience in both academia and the software industry. As a university lecturer, he taught a range of core computer science courses and to make learning more accessible during the pandemic, developed a digital course hub for his students. This academic experience is complemented by his work as a software engineer, where he focused on improving system architecture and developing IoT solutions. In a key role, he contributed to the foundational technology for OTORide, a rideshare application, by developing the systems for its smart scooter and bike locks.
