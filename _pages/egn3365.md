**EGN 3365**, Structure and Properties of Materials [[Website](https://mse.ucf.edu/courses/)] [Fall 2024, Fall 2025]

This course provides an introduction to the fundamental principles that link the structure of materials to their properties and performance. Students explore atomic structure and bonding, crystal structures and imperfections, solidification, phase transformations, phase diagrams, and heat treatment. The course also covers mechanical, electrical, thermal, and optical properties of materials, along with modern characterization techniques. By drawing on concepts from chemistry, physics, and mathematics, students gain a strong foundation in materials science that is broadly applicable to fields such as mechanical engineering, manufacturing, product design, and materials chemistry.

Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to recognize and compare major classes of materials—including metals, ceramics, polymers, composites, and semiconductors—while understanding how their structures determine properties. They will apply fundamental scientific principles to explain materials behavior, communicate effectively using modern technical terminology, and appreciate the critical relationships between structure, processing, and performance.
