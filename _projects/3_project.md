We are solving the problem of geolocalization using cross-view geolocalization in images and videos. 

[Github Page](https://github.com/svyas23/GAMa/blob/main/README.md)]
In the gif, we see an example of a large aerial region corresponding to a video, along with the video frames at each second. We can see the trajectory of the video on the aerial image. Subsequent GPS points are related by time and geographical location and we make use of this information for geo-localization at video level.
